Python Algorithms and Mathematics

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that demonstrate the use of algorithms and mathematics. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including:

    Pong - A simple pong game that uses object-oriented programming and collision detection algorithms.
    Fibonacci Sequence - A program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive algorithm.
    Area of a Triangle - A program that calculates the area of a triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.
    Linear Regression - A program that uses linear regression to fit a line to a set of data points.
    Logistic Regression - A program that uses logistic regression to classify data points into two categories.

The projects are designed to be educational and informative. They are a great way to learn about the use of algorithms and mathematics in Python.

Usage
